                <p>
                    Reefton Hideaway has a long history in the local community, helping to support the economy and workers in various ways over the years. It was originally built in 1947 by the New Zealand government for use in housing miners. Later, it played a role in housing forestry workers. In modern times, Reefton hideaway acts as both restful accommodation and a place for community.
                    We heartily believe in the importance of coming together and sharing the human experience.   
                    <br/><br/>             
                    The Hideaway offers accommodation throughout the year and includes a 26 bed lodge, along with 18 individual cottages, and a variety of meeting rooms and living areas. It is a fantastic place for families, group retreats, gatherings, couples, and more. Whatever your situation is, there is a room for you here.

                <h2>About Reefton</h2>
                <p className="about">
                    Reefton itself is a small west coast town that is a perfect resting point between Christchurch and Nelson. The town was founded around 1870 and was a hub for innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    The town owes its initial growth, in part, to the discovery of gold in a quartz reef. Reefton’s name comes from that reef, as does the nickname Quartzopolis.

                    As the gold rush spirit died, the town’s population declined, only to be revived with new industries, including coal mining and foresting. Innovation and entrepreneurship accompanied the various industries. And, in 1888, Reefton became New Zealand’s first town with electricity – earning it the name ‘Town of Light’.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Reefton’s history can be seen throughout the town and the wider region. Many of the buildings in the town retain their classic styles, while there is a Bearded Mining Company at the Miners Hut in the city that replicates the nature of life in Reefton back in the 1860s.

<p className="about">
                    The Hideaway has a mid century history as being built by the NZ government c.1947 entirely of native rimu timber. It was initially a miner’s residence and later a home to forestry workers. 

                    Our customers enjoy the luxuries of modern accomodation within a building with deep historical roots.

                    Reefton's Hideaway sits on 9,990m<sup>2</sup> of flat land in the heart of Reefton village (previously known as Quartzopolis, because of its past gold-bearing quartz reefs); Reefton is nestled between the Paparoa Mountains and the Victoria Forest Park incorporating the upper catchment of the sparkly Inangahua river. 
                    You can enjoy cool summer swims in our rivers and skiing in the Lewis Pass. 
                    Neighboured by The Paparoa and Old Ghost Road cycle trails, the Hideaway is frequented by bikers and drivers looking for a place to rest their weary legs. 

                    Our Hideaway is open all year round. It offers very quiet 18 self-contained cottages and a 26-bed lodge. Family friendly for all types of gatherings or retreats. An ideal meeting point between Christchurch and Nelson.
